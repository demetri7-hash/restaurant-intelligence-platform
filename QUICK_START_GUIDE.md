# Autonomous AI Development System - Quick Start Guide

## Overview
This system creates an AI assistant that works autonomously on your codebase using ONLY real data, never placeholders. It maintains documentation, deploys continuously, and waits for your feedback on live deployments.

## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Copy Files to Your Project
```bash
# Copy these files to your project root:
cp AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md ./
cp PROJECT_SUMMARY_template.md ./PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
cp PROCESS_LOG_template.md ./PROCESS_LOG.md
cp TODO_template.md ./TODO.md
cp automation_setup.md ./

# Create automation scripts
mkdir scripts
# Copy the shell scripts from automation_setup.md to ./scripts/
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project Documentation
```bash
# Edit PROJECT_SUMMARY.md with your project details
# Edit TODO.md with your actual tasks
# Set up your real database/API credentials in .env
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Copilot (if using)
```bash
# Install Copilot CLI
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli

# Add VS Code settings from automation_setup.md
# Enable maximum suggestions and auto-completions
```

### 4. Set Up Automation
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Add to package.json:
npm run autonomous    # Start autonomous session
npm run auto-deploy   # Deploy current changes
npm run check-connections  # Test real data
```

## üéØ How It Works

### AI Assistant Workflow
1. **Reads Documentation**: Always checks PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, TODO.md, PROCESS_LOG.md
2. **Selects Task**: Picks highest priority item from TODO.md
3. **Implements with Real Data**: No placeholders, connects to real APIs/databases
4. **Tests**: Runs tests with real data connections
5. **Commits & Deploys**: Pushes to git, deploys to staging
6. **Documents**: Updates PROCESS_LOG.md with detailed results
7. **Waits for Feedback**: Pauses for human review of live deployment
8. **Continues**: Moves to next task if feedback is positive

### Your Role
- Review live deployments and provide feedback
- Add new tasks to TODO.md
- Monitor PROCESS_LOG.md for progress
- Approve/reject changes via feedback system

## üìã Essential Commands

### For AI Assistant
```bash
# Before starting work
cat PROJECT_SUMMARY.md  # Understand current state
cat TODO.md            # Check priorities
tail -20 PROCESS_LOG.md # See recent changes

# During work
npm run check-connections  # Verify real data access
npm test                  # Test with real data
npm run auto-deploy       # Deploy and document

# After each change
# Update PROCESS_LOG.md
# Mark TODO items complete
# Wait for feedback
```

### For Human (You)
```bash
# Review current status
cat PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
tail -10 PROCESS_LOG.md

# Provide feedback
echo "continue" > feedback.txt      # Approve and continue
echo "approved" > feedback.txt      # Good work, continue
echo "pause" > feedback.txt         # Stop for manual review
echo "fix auth issue" > feedback.txt # Specific issue to address

# Add new tasks
# Edit TODO.md directly

# Check deployments
# Visit staging URLs from PROCESS_LOG.md
```

## üîß Configuration Templates

### .env File (Real Credentials Only)
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port

# APIs
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...

# Deployment
STAGING_URL=https://staging.yourapp.com
PRODUCTION_URL=https://yourapp.com
```

### GitHub Secrets (for automation)
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `API_KEY`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Any other real service credentials

## üö® Critical Rules for AI

### NEVER DO:
- ‚ùå Use placeholder data
- ‚ùå Mock API responses
- ‚ùå Skip deployment steps
- ‚ùå Work without updating docs
- ‚ùå Continue without feedback after deployment

### ALWAYS DO:
- ‚úÖ Connect to real services
- ‚úÖ Test with real data
- ‚úÖ Commit every change
- ‚úÖ Deploy to staging
- ‚úÖ Update documentation
- ‚úÖ Wait for feedback

## üìñ Documentation Files Explained

### PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for project state
- **Updated**: Before major changes, after deployments
- **Contains**: Architecture, tech stack, deployment status, real data connections

### PROCESS_LOG.md
- **Purpose**: Detailed log of every change made
- **Updated**: After each commit/deployment
- **Contains**: What changed, commands run, deployment results, human feedback

### TODO.md
- **Purpose**: Prioritized task list with acceptance criteria
- **Updated**: When tasks are added/completed
- **Contains**: Specific tasks with real data requirements

### AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **Purpose**: Complete instructions for AI behavior
- **Updated**: Rarely, when workflow changes
- **Contains**: All rules, workflows, and restrictions

## üöÄ Start Your First Autonomous Session

1. **Prepare Your Project**:
   ```bash
   # Set up real database connection
   # Add real API credentials to .env
   # Create initial TODO items
   ```

2. **Start the AI Assistant**:
   ```bash
   # Give the AI these instructions:
   "Follow the instructions in AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md exactly. 
   Start by reading PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, TODO.md, and PROCESS_LOG.md.
   Then begin working on the highest priority TODO item using ONLY real data.
   Commit and deploy each change, then wait for my feedback."
   ```

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   ```bash
   # Watch the files update
   watch -n 5 "tail -5 PROCESS_LOG.md"
   
   # Check deployments
   curl https://staging.yourapp.com
   ```

4. **Provide Feedback**:
   ```bash
   echo "continue" > feedback.txt  # When deployment looks good
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### AI Wants to Use Placeholder Data
- **Problem**: AI suggests mock data or placeholders
- **Solution**: "Stop. Use real data only. Connect to actual database/API. No placeholders allowed."

### Deployment Fails
- **Problem**: Deploy script fails
- **Solution**: AI should troubleshoot the real issue, not revert to mocks

### AI Skips Documentation
- **Problem**: Files not being updated
- **Solution**: "Read AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md. Update documentation BEFORE making changes."

### AI Continues Without Feedback
- **Problem**: AI moves to next task without waiting
- **Solution**: "Wait for feedback.txt file before continuing. Deploy and pause."

## üìû Support

If the AI assistant gets confused or off-track:

1. **Reset with instructions**: "Read AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md and start over"
2. **Check documentation**: Make sure all .md files are up to date
3. **Verify real data**: Confirm all connections are to real services
4. **Review process log**: Check what the AI did differently

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:
- ‚úÖ AI always connects to real services
- ‚úÖ Every change is committed and deployed
- ‚úÖ Documentation stays current
- ‚úÖ AI waits for feedback after deployments
- ‚úÖ TODO list gets systematically completed
- ‚úÖ You can review live deployments instead of reading code

**Remember**: This system is designed for AI autonomy with human oversight. The AI does the implementation work, you provide strategic direction and approval.
